# Running SUMO with Python demo

This directory contains all the required elements to run some example
simulations using SUMO and Python. Use `main.py`.

Available simulations:
* `single_intersection.sumocfg` - a config file for running a simple simulation
with a single interesection;
* `cracow.sumocfg` - a config file for running a simulation of Cracow city.

Both simulations are 60 steps long and use randomly generated traffic.
