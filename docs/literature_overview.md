# List of useful terms
- *compatible streams* - two compatible streams of cars can safely cross the intersection simultaneously.
- *stage / phase* - traffic light signals allowing a predefined compatible traffic streams to cross the intersection simultaneously.
- *signal cycle* - one repetition of the basic series of stages.
- *cycle time* - duration of a cycle.
- *integreen time* - time inserted between consecutive stages to avoid interference between antagonistic streams.
- *split* - the ratio of green and red lights within one cycle (for each light).
- *offset* - a delay between the starting times of green periods of two neighboring traffic lights along the same traffic route.

### A Review on Swarm Intelligence and Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving the Traffic Signal Control Problem (2020)
* algorithms inspired by nature has been applied for solving the TSC problem for 2 decades;
* evaluation (fitness function calculation) is done using a simulation;
* genetic algorithms are most prevalent among evolutionary algorithms;
* for evolutionary algorithms: green times vector for each phase are the most popular decision variables, the most picked objective to minimize is the time delay (either as a single objective or within multiple objectives), some modifications of standard GA are used (NSGA which modifies the selection operator), differential evolution and genetic programming methods are used as well.
