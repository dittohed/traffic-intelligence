### A Review on Swarm Intelligence and Evolutionary Algorithms for Solving the Traffic Signal Control Problem (2020)
* algorithms inspired by nature has been applied for solving the TSC problem for 2 decades;
* evaluation (fitness function calculation) is done using a simulation;
* genetic algorithms are most prevalent among evolutionary algorithms;
* for evolutionary algorithms: green times vector for each phase are the most popular decision variables, the most picked objective to minimize is the time delay (either as a single objective or within multiple objectives), some modifications of standard GA are used (NSGA which modifies the selection operator), differential evolution and genetic programming methods are used as well.
